  <h1>LESLIE'S WEBSITE</h1>
  <p>Hi, welcome to Leslie Kerman's website, it's still WIP rn, but I'll probably be posting more interesting things
    here in the future.</p>
  <p>I'm trying to achieve the look and feel of a retro 1984 desktop interface for this website, like Macintosh.</p>
  <p>And I'm trying to keep everything, including the images, in 1 MB per page (most pages will probably be much smaller
    than that), because I hate how most modern webpages takes forever to load.</p>
  <p>This font is actually the font used in the old Macintosh Systems - Chicago. There is a vector version of the font
    in later versions of the OS, but I just really like the 8-bit bitmap one, it gives a unique retro feeling. But it
    does mean that for CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters, I'll have to use bitmap images, because the font only
    supports English characters, but that wouldn't be too much of a problem because this blog will be mostly in English.
    Plus, monochrome, pixelated images don't usually cost much data when optimally compressed.</p>
