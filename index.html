  <h1>Leslie's website</h1>
  <p>Hi, welcome to Leslie Kerman's website, it's still WIP rn, I'll probably be posting my work here in the future</p>
  <p>I'm trying to give it a retro 1984 feel like the Macintosh, and I'll try to optimize the loading speed of the website as much as possible, I really hate how modern website often cost a dozens of megabytes of data to load.</p>
  <p>Like this font I'm using rn, it only costs 11KB, and I'll try to keep everything, including the images, inside 2MB per page</p>
  <br>
  <p>hello</p>
